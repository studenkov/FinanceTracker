# Preflight: Spring MCP

This skill is part of the **Spring Agent Toolkit** and is designed to work with the **Spring MCP server** (provided by
the Amplicode IntelliJ plugin). Before doing anything else, check your tool list for any Spring MCP tool — they are
exposed under the `amplicode` MCP server (e.g. `get_project_summary`, `list_module_dependencies`, `get_entity_details`);
harnesses that flatten MCP tools into the tool list use the `mcp__amplicode__` prefix on the same names.

- **If at least one Amplicode tool is available** — MCP is connected. Proceed with the skill below.
- **If none are available** — stop and invoke the **`amplicode-install`** skill (bundled with the Spring Agent Toolkit).
  It installs the Amplicode plugin and walks the user through the **«Настроить Spring Agent»** welcome-screen button +
  MCP-client restart. After it completes, the MCP tools become available — resume this skill.
- If `amplicode-install` is not registered in your skill list, tell the user (in their language): *"This skill needs the
  Amplicode IntelliJ plugin and its MCP server. Install it from https://amplicode.ru/marketplace into IntelliJ IDEA
  Ultimate/Community or GigaIDE, open any project, click «Настроить Spring Agent» on the Amplicode welcome screen, then
  restart your MCP client."*

# Explore Application

Collects primary project context in steps 0–6. Execute steps sequentially —
each one builds on the results of the previous.

**Important:** if context has already been collected in the current conversation, do not repeat
the exploration — use what is already known.

---

## Step 0 — Predict involvement from the user's request

Tell the user: `Step 0/6: Analyzing request...`

**Do NOT call any tools in this step.**

Read the user's request and reason about what the implementation likely involves.
Without calling any tools, make educated guesses based on naming conventions, domain language,
and typical Spring Boot patterns:

- **Entities** — what domain objects are likely involved? (e.g. "create order" → `Order`, `OrderItem`)
- **Repositories** — which repositories probably exist for those entities?
- **Services** — what service classes are likely needed?
- **Controllers** — what REST controllers probably handle this area?
- **Other beans/components** — mappers, validators, event listeners, configs, etc.
- **Files** — what non-Java files are likely relevant? (e.g. DB migration scripts, `application.properties`, Liquibase
  changelogs, HTML templates). Do not list Java classes here — they belong to the categories above.

Build a preliminary gap list containing only what is genuinely required:

```
### Predicted involvement:
- Entities: Order, OrderItem, Customer
- Repositories: OrderRepository, CustomerRepository
- Services: OrderService
- Controllers: OrderController
- Other: OrderMapper
- Files: src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__create_orders.sql, application.properties
```

This prediction drives steps 1–5 — skip anything irrelevant to the task.

---

## Step 1 — Define exploration goal and select paths

Tell the user: `Step 1/6: Selecting exploration paths...`

**Do NOT call any tools in this step.**

Read the current conversation context — the user's request, any prior exploration results, remaining gaps — and
formulate the key exploration goal in one sentence. Show it to the user:

```
### Exploration goal:
Understand the Order aggregate structure and verify what repositories and mappers already exist.
```

Using this goal, go through each exploration path below and explicitly decide: **include** or **skip**, with a one-line
reason. Do this for every path — do not skip the evaluation itself.

**Project structure**

- **Fetch project summary** — include if the tech stack, Spring Boot version, or module structure are needed. Skip if
  the task is narrowly scoped to specific classes.
- **Detect persistence stack** — include if any entity-touching path below is selected AND the stack (JPA vs JDBC) is
  not yet known from the conversation. Call `list_module_dependencies`: dependency on `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` /
  `hibernate` → JPA; `spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc` / `spring-data-jdbc` → JDBC; neither → no supported persistence
  layer, skip entity-touching paths.
- **List domain entities** — include ONLY if the domain area is completely unknown and you cannot predict which entities
  are involved. If entities are already named in the request or predictable from context — skip. Do NOT use to get
  entity structure or resolve FQNs.
- **List REST endpoints** — include only if you need to check what already exists to avoid duplication or understand
  conventions. Skip if the request fully defines all endpoints from scratch.

**Domain model**

- **Get entity description** — include if entity fields or annotations are needed. Apply only to predicted entities, not
  all entities. Route by stack: JPA → `get_entity_details`, see [
  `references/entity-description.md`](references/entity-description.md); JDBC → `get_jdbc_entity_details`, see [
  `references/entity-description-jdbc.md`](references/entity-description-jdbc.md).
- **Get deep model from entity** — include if relationships across multiple entities need to be traversed (e.g. nested
  resources, cascades). **JPA only** — for JDBC `get_jdbc_entity_details` already returns the full owned-children tree (
  `aggregates`) and inverse links (`referencedBy`); use the DDD path below instead. See [
  `references/deep-model-based-on-jpa.md`](references/deep-model-based-on-jpa.md).
- **Get DDD model from entity** — include if aggregate boundaries matter (e.g. URL design, cascade planning, DTO
  shaping). JPA: follow [`references/ddd-model-based-on-jpa.md`](references/ddd-model-based-on-jpa.md). JDBC: call
  `get_jdbc_entity_details` and read `aggregateRootFqn`, `aggregates`, `referencedBy` directly — Spring Data JDBC
  enforces aggregate boundaries at the framework level.

**Persistence**

- **Get entity repositories** — include if repositories for predicted entities are unknown or need to be verified. See [
  `references/entity-repositories.md`](references/entity-repositories.md).
- **Get entity components** — include if you need a full picture of all components (repositories, services, controllers)
  for an entity. See [`references/entity-components.md`](references/entity-components.md).

**Services**

- **Get entity services** — include if services for predicted entities are unknown or need to be verified. See [
  `references/entity-services.md`](references/entity-services.md).

**Mappers**

- **Get entity mappers** — include if the task involves DTOs and you need to know what mappers exist. See [
  `references/entity-mappers.md`](references/entity-mappers.md).

**DTOs**

- **Get entity DTOs** — include if you need to know what DTO classes already exist. See [
  `references/entity-dtos.md`](references/entity-dtos.md).

**REST layer**

- **Get entity controllers** — include if you need to find which controllers are associated with an entity. See [
  `references/entity-controllers.md`](references/entity-controllers.md).

Write out the evaluation explicitly, then produce the final plan from included paths only:

**Example** — for a request "Add a paginated endpoint returning all orders for a customer with order items and product
names":

```
### Path evaluation:
- Fetch project summary: INCLUDE — need Spring Boot version and module structure
- Detect persistence stack: INCLUDE — entity-touching paths selected and stack unknown from conversation
- List domain entities: SKIP — Order, Customer, OrderItem, Product are predictable from the request
- List REST endpoints: INCLUDE — need to check if an orders endpoint already exists
- Get entity description: INCLUDE — need Order, OrderItem, Product fields for response DTO design
- Get deep model: SKIP — relationship structure is clear: Order → OrderItem → Product
- Get DDD model: SKIP — no cascade planning needed, just a read endpoint
- Get entity repositories: INCLUDE — need to verify OrderRepository exists and supports pagination
- Get entity components: SKIP — repositories are sufficient, no need for full component chain
- Get entity services: SKIP — no service layer changes expected
- Get entity mappers: INCLUDE — need to know if OrderMapper already exists before creating DTOs
- Get entity DTOs: INCLUDE — need to know if OrderDto already exists
- Get entity controllers: SKIP — will check via "List REST endpoints" instead

### Exploration plan:
1. Fetch project summary
2. Detect persistence stack
3. List REST endpoints (filter to order-related controllers)
4. Get entity description for Order, OrderItem, Product
5. Get entity repositories for Order
6. Get entity mappers for Order
7. Get entity DTOs for Order
```

---

## Step 2 — Load references

Tell the user: `Step 2/6: Loading relevant references...`

**Do NOT call any tools in this step.**

Based on the exploration plan from step 1, load only the references needed for the selected paths **that have not
already been loaded in this conversation**.
After loading, proceed directly to step 3 — **do NOT search files, glob, or explore the project structure manually. All
project information must be obtained exclusively via MCP tools in steps 3–5.**

| Selected path                 | Reference to load                                                                |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Get entity description (JPA)  | [`references/entity-description.md`](references/entity-description.md)           |
| Get entity description (JDBC) | [`references/entity-description-jdbc.md`](references/entity-description-jdbc.md) |
| Get deep model from entity    | [`references/deep-model-based-on-jpa.md`](references/deep-model-based-on-jpa.md) |
| Get DDD model from entity     | [`references/ddd-model-based-on-jpa.md`](references/ddd-model-based-on-jpa.md)   |
| Get entity repositories       | [`references/entity-repositories.md`](references/entity-repositories.md)         |
| Get entity components         | [`references/entity-components.md`](references/entity-components.md)             |
| Get entity services           | [`references/entity-services.md`](references/entity-services.md)                 |
| Get entity mappers            | [`references/entity-mappers.md`](references/entity-mappers.md)                   |
| Get entity DTOs               | [`references/entity-dtos.md`](references/entity-dtos.md)                         |
| Get entity controllers        | [`references/entity-controllers.md`](references/entity-controllers.md)           |

If none of the paths require references — skip this step and proceed to step 3.

---

## Step 3 — Build unified exploration plan

Tell the user: `Step 3/6: Building exploration plan...`

**Do NOT call any tools in this step.**

Using the selected paths from step 1 and the processes described in the loaded references,
build a single unified numbered plan of MCP calls to execute in steps 4–5.
Each item must be a concrete MCP tool call, not a category name.

```
### Unified exploration plan:
1. get_project_summary
2. list_project_endpoints
3. list_all_domain_entities (regexPattern=Owner) — resolve FQN
4. get_entity_details (Owner FQN)
5. get_entity_details (Pet FQN)
6. get_entity_details (Visit FQN)
7. list_entity_repositories (Owner FQN)
8. list_entity_repositories (Pet FQN)
9. list_entity_repositories (Visit FQN)
```

---

## Step 4 — Execute exploration plan via subagent

Tell the user: `Step 4/6: Executing exploration plan...`

Spawn a subagent and pass it the following instructions:

```
Execute the exploration plan below by calling each MCP tool in order.
Use MCP tools directly (e.g. get_entity_details, list_entity_repositories).

Collect and return ALL results in full — do not summarize or truncate.

Secret redaction: if any returned value belongs to a key that looks like a credential
(`password`, `passwd`, `secret`, `token`, `api-key`, `apikey`, `access-key`, `private-key`,
`credentials`, `client-secret`, `auth`, or similar), replace only the value with `[REDACTED]`
and keep the key and surrounding structure intact. Never echo credential values verbatim.

Plan:
<paste the numbered plan from step 3 here>
```

Wait for the subagent to complete and collect all results before proceeding.

---

## Step 5 — Build exploration report

Tell the user: `Step 5/6: Building exploration report...`

**Do NOT call any tools in this step — reason only from subagent results.**

Synthesize all findings collected across all exploration cycles into a single report. Include only what is genuinely
valuable for the task — omit noise and obvious defaults.

Structure:

```
### Exploration Report

**Stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot 3.x · Maven
**Persistence:** JPA   <!-- JPA · JDBC · none — required when any entity-touching path ran -->

**Domain model:**
- Order (id, status, totalAmount) → has many OrderItem → references Product
- Customer (id, name, email)

**Repositories:**
- OrderRepository — extends JpaRepository, supports pagination
- CustomerRepository — extends JpaRepository

**Services:**
- OrderService — handles order creation and status transitions

**Mappers:**
- OrderMapper (MapStruct) — maps Order ↔ OrderDto

**DTOs:**
- OrderDto, OrderItemDto — already exist

**REST API (relevant endpoints):**
- GET /orders — paginated list
- POST /orders — create order

**Notable findings:**
- SecurityConfig present — all endpoints require authentication
- No mapper for Customer — will need to create one
```

---

## Step 5.5 — Formulate implicit assumptions

Tell the user: `Step 5.5/6: Formulating implicit assumptions...`

**Do NOT call any tools in this step — reason only from subagent results and the user's request.**

Based on the exploration report and the user's request, identify everything the user did **not** explicitly say but
likely expects from the implementation. These are implicit assumptions — unstated requirements, conventions, and design
decisions the user probably takes for granted.

Focus on:

- **Behavioral expectations** — e.g. "user probably expects soft delete, not hard delete", "pagination assumed to be
  offset-based"
- **Security/access control** — e.g. "endpoint likely should require authentication like all others in this project"
- **Validation** — e.g. "fields like email and price are likely expected to be validated"
- **Error handling** — e.g. "returning 404 on missing entity is likely expected, not 500"
- **Conventions** — e.g. "response format likely expected to match existing endpoints (camelCase, wrapped in data
  field)"
- **Related side effects** — e.g. "creating an order probably expected to update inventory or send a notification"
- **DTO shape** — e.g. "response probably expected to include nested items, not just IDs"

Output all assumptions explicitly so they can be validated or corrected:

```
### Implicit assumptions:
1. The new endpoint should require authentication — all existing endpoints use SecurityConfig with auth required.
2. Response format should match existing endpoints — camelCase JSON, no wrapper object.
3. Pagination is expected to be offset-based (Pageable) — consistent with other list endpoints.
4. Missing entity should return 404, not 500 — standard REST convention followed elsewhere.
5. Price field is expected to be validated as positive — consistent with other monetary fields in the domain.
6. OrderItem list in response should include product name and quantity — implied by "order details" framing.
```

If no implicit assumptions can be identified — state that explicitly:

```
### Implicit assumptions: none identified — the request is fully specified.
```

---

## Step 6 — Decide on next cycle

Tell the user: `Step 6/6: Evaluating next cycle...`

**Do NOT call any tools in this step — reason only from subagent results.**

Predict the value of an additional cycle (0–100): how critical are the remaining gaps, and are they resolvable via MCP?
Show score and reasoning:

```
### Additional cycle value: 87/100 → additional exploration cycle required.
```

**Score > 80** — go to **Step 1**. **Score ≤ 80** — stop.
