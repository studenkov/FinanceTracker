/*
 * Loads a JaCoCo .exec coverage file into IntelliJ IDEA's coverage subsystem.
 *
 * This is the Kotlin body passed verbatim to the Amplicode/steroid
 * `steroid_execute_code` MCP tool (it runs inside IntelliJ's runtime as a
 * suspend script body — `project` is in scope, and there is NO `return@...`
 * label available, so control flow uses plain if/else).
 *
 * Vendored from the show-coverage-in-ide skill so this skill stands alone. The
 * ONLY divergence is the SHOW_PANEL default (see below); keep the rest in sync if
 * that skill's copy is fixed.
 *
 * Knobs set by the caller by editing the CONFIG block below before sending:
 *   EXEC_REL_PATH  — path to a specific .exec, relative to the project base.
 *                    Leave empty ("") to pick it up automatically (see below).
 *   NEWER_THAN_MS  — only consider .exec files written at/after this epoch-millis,
 *                    i.e. the `startedAtMs` that ACTION="run" returned. This is how
 *                    the caller says "show what THIS run produced". 0 = no filter,
 *                    which falls back to the newest .exec on disk.
 *   SHOW_PANEL     — true:  activate the suite and open the Coverage tool window.
 *                    false: activate the suite (gutters paint) and keep the
 *                           Coverage tool window closed.
 *
 * On auto-discovery: which .exec a build produces is project-specific — a merged
 * one exists only if the build defines a merge task, otherwise there are just the
 * per-suite files. So never hardcode a name: take the NEWEST .exec written by this
 * run. When a build does merge, the merge task runs last and its output wins;
 * when it doesn't, the per-suite file wins. Both are what the report was built
 * from. NEWER_THAN_MS is what makes "by this run" true — without it an aborted
 * earlier run can leave a per-suite .exec newer than the real one.
 *
 * SHOW_PANEL defaults to TRUE here, unlike in show-coverage-in-ide: there the
 * user asked for gutters and a popping panel would steal focus for nothing, while
 * here the coverage report IS what was asked for, so the IDE must show it.
 *
 * NOTE: chooseSuitesBundle() opens the Coverage tool window asynchronously by
 * itself, so SHOW_PANEL=false cannot just skip show() — it must wait for that
 * auto-open and hide the window back.
