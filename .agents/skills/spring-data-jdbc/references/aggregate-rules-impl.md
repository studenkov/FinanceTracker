# Aggregate Implementation Rules

Apply these rules when reasoning about or modifying aggregate boundaries in Spring Data JDBC. All rules assume the
conventions resolved in Step 1 of `aggregate-conventions.md` are already applied.

`AggregateReference` is imported from `org.springframework.data.jdbc.core.mapping.AggregateReference`.

## Identifying the role of an entity

Use `get_jdbc_entity_details` to read three cross-aggregate facts that are not obvious from a single file:

- `aggregateRootFqn` — null → this is itself a root; non-null → this is an owned child of the named root.
- `aggregates` — only populated for roots; lists owned children recursively, each with `cardinality` and `fieldName`.
- `referencedBy` — every other aggregate that links here via `AggregateReference`, with the `ownerEntityFqn` (the entity
  holding the field) and the root of the holder's aggregate.

`relationships` carries every outbound edge with a `relationType` of `ONE_TO_ONE`, `ONE_TO_MANY`, `AGGREGATE_REFERENCE`,
or `EMBEDDED`. Only `AGGREGATE_REFERENCE` crosses an aggregate boundary; `ONE_TO_ONE`/`ONE_TO_MANY` are owned children
inside the same aggregate; `EMBEDDED` is a value object flattened into the current row — **not** a member of the
aggregate's owned-entity tree.

Note: the tool itself recommends reading the file directly when you are about to modify the entity. The tool is best
used for the three cross-aggregate facts above — for in-file structure (field list, id type, current annotations) read
the source.

---

## Without `get_jdbc_entity_details` (MCP fallback)

If the MCP tool is unreachable, derive the same four facts by reading source files. Announce up front that you are in
fallback mode.

The project is **Kotlin-first** (Kotlin 2.2.20 primary; some Java). Every grep must scan both `*.kt` and `*.java` — do *
*not** restrict with `-t java`. Annotations also frequently sit on their own line above the field/constructor parameter
they decorate, so a single-line regex over annotation-and-target will produce false negatives. Use a two-step pattern: (

1) find files that contain the annotation; (2) open each file and read the surrounding declarations.

**`idField.type`** — find the field annotated with `@Id` (import `org.springframework.data.annotation.Id`) and read its
declared type.

1. Open the target entity source file (both `.java` and `.kt` are valid).
2. Look for `@Id`. In Java/Kotlin classes it usually sits on a field; in records, on a record component; in Kotlin data
   classes, on a constructor parameter (often as `@field:Id` or `@property:Id`).
3. If `@Id` is not in the target file, follow the inheritance chain. In Java: `class MyTable extends BaseTable`. In
   Kotlin: `class MyTable : BaseTable()`. Open the parent source and repeat — the project's test fixtures use this
   pattern (`MyTable extends BaseTable` where `BaseTable` holds the `@Id`). Walk further up if the parent itself
   inherits.
4. The type declared next to `@Id` is the id type.

**`aggregateRootFqn`** — is the target a root or an owned child? Owned-child status comes **only** from
`@MappedCollection` (or a plain entity-typed field that resolves to a `@Table` class) on a parent. `@Embedded` does NOT
make the embedded type an aggregate member — it is a value object flattened into the parent's row.

Two-step search (works for Java and Kotlin):

1. List candidate parents — files containing `@MappedCollection` or a field whose declared type is `Target` (or a
   collection of `Target`):
   ```
   rg --files-with-matches "@MappedCollection|\\bTarget\\b"
   ```
2. Open each candidate file and inspect its field/property declarations. Read across line breaks — the annotation and
   the field/property are typically on separate lines:
   ```java
   @MappedCollection(idColumn = "order_id")
   private Set<OrderItem> items;   // Java
   ```
   ```kotlin
   @MappedCollection(idColumn = "order_id")
   var items: MutableSet<OrderItem> = mutableSetOf()   // Kotlin
   ```
   A field is an inbound link to `Target` if the declared type is `Target`, `Collection<Target>`, `Set<Target>`,
   `List<Target>`, or `Map<_, Target>` AND it carries `@MappedCollection` (or no annotation at all, with the type being
   itself `@Table`-annotated).

The first inbound match is the parent; recurse up the `@MappedCollection` chain until you find a `@Table` entity with no
inbound `@MappedCollection` — that is the aggregate root. If no inbound exists, the target is itself the root.

Note: an `@Embedded.Empty` / `@Embedded.Nullable` / `@Embedded(...)` field pointing at the target does **not** make the
target a child of the holder's aggregate. Embedded classes are value objects; they typically should not even be `@Table`
-annotated — see the "Embedded objects do not have identity" rule below. If you find a `@Table` entity that is
`@Embedded` from another entity, that is itself a code smell to flag, not a clue about aggregate membership.

**`aggregates`** (only meaningful for roots) — open the root's source file and list every field/property annotated with
`@MappedCollection` (or any plain entity-typed field whose declared type is itself `@Table`-annotated). Each such value
type is an owned child entity. Recurse into each child to find nested owned children. Cardinality: a collection /
`Map` / `List` / `Set` ⇒ `ONE_TO_MANY`; a scalar reference ⇒ `ONE_TO_ONE`. Skip `@Embedded` fields here — they are value
objects, not members of the aggregate's entity tree.

**`referencedBy`** — find inbound `AggregateReference<Target, ...>` fields. A single-line regex over the whole generic
is unreliable — Kotlin (and occasionally Java) wraps long generics across lines, e.g.:

```kotlin
var ref: AggregateReference<
    Target,
    Long
>? = null
```

Use a two-step search that does not assume same-line layout:

1. Find candidate files — those that contain **both** `AggregateReference` and the target type's simple name. Intersect
   two file lists:
   ```
   comm -12 \
     <(rg --files-with-matches "\bAggregateReference\b" | sort) \
     <(rg --files-with-matches "\bTarget\b" | sort)
   ```
   (or run the second `rg` only over the first list — equivalent and avoids the temp ordering.)
2. Open each candidate file and confirm by eye that the target appears in the **first** generic slot of an
   `AggregateReference<…, …>` field declaration (not as the `IdType` in slot two: `AggregateReference<Other, Target>`
   would be `Target` used as an id type — different relationship and a sign of a different bug, not an inbound link).

Each confirmed match is an inbound cross-aggregate link. For each match's owner class, walk back up the
`@MappedCollection` chain (per the `aggregateRootFqn` procedure) to find the aggregate root that ultimately holds the
reference.

The manual procedure is slower and less reliable than one MCP call — treat it as a last resort, not the default.

---

## Rule: Repositories only for aggregate roots

A Spring Data JDBC repository may exist **only** for an aggregate root.

When asked to create a repository, run `get_jdbc_entity_details` for the target. If `aggregateRootFqn != null` — refuse
with:

> "<target> is an owned child of aggregate <aggregateRootFqn>. Owned children must be reached through the root's
> repository. To work with this entity in isolation, either (a) load the root and navigate to the child, or (b) split
> this
> child off into a separate aggregate root — but that requires replacing the parent's `@MappedCollection` with
`AggregateReference<<target>, <id>>` and adding a `@Table` annotation+repository for the child."

Do not generate the repository anyway. Do not silently extend an inappropriate base interface.

---

## Rule: Owned children are loaded and saved with the root

To create / update / delete an owned child, mutate the parent and call `rootRepository.save(root)`. The framework
re-inserts the child collection on every update.

```java
// CORRECT — mutate child via root
Order order = orderRepository.findById(orderId).orElseThrow();
order.getItems().add(new OrderItem(/* ... */));
orderRepository.save(order);
```

```java
// WRONG — direct repository call on an owned child
orderItemRepository.save(item); // owned child must not have a repository
```

To query owned children in isolation (e.g. "all items with status = PICKED across orders"), write a custom `@Query` on
the root's repository that joins to the child table and returns a projection — do not introduce an OrderItemRepository.

---

## Rule: Cross-aggregate references use `AggregateReference<Target, IdType>`

When this aggregate must point at another aggregate root, declare the field as `AggregateReference<Target, IdType>`. The
`IdType` must equal the target's `@Id` type — fetch it via `get_jdbc_entity_details` on the target (`idField.type`).
Never widen it to `Number`/`Serializable`.

```java
// CORRECT
@Column(value = "customer_id")
private AggregateReference<Customer, Long> customer;
```

To resolve the target, the service layer dereferences via the target's repository:

```java
public CustomerView resolve(Order order) {
    Long customerId = order.getCustomer().getId();
    Customer c = customerRepository.findById(customerId).orElseThrow();
    return toView(c);
}
```

`AggregateReference.to(id)` is the only public factory. **It rejects null** — the contract is `id` must not be null, and
calling `to(null)` throws `IllegalArgumentException` at runtime.

Nullable cross-aggregate links are expressed by storing `null` directly in the field, never by wrapping a null id:

```java
// CORRECT — assigning the field for a non-null id
order.setCustomer(AggregateReference.to(customer.getId()));
```

```java
// CORRECT — nullable link: store null in the field directly
order.setCustomer(null);
```

```java
// CORRECT — guard before wrapping (this is the pattern the project's
// MapStruct mapper generator emits)
order.setCustomer(customerId == null ? null : AggregateReference.to(customerId));
```

```java
// WRONG — AggregateReference.to(null) throws at runtime
order.setCustomer(AggregateReference.to(null));
```

```java
// WRONG — raw FK on an entity that belongs in a different aggregate
@Column(value = "customer_id")
private Long customerId;
```

```java
// WRONG — @MappedCollection used to cross an aggregate boundary
@MappedCollection(idColumn = "customer_id")
private Set<Customer> customers; // Customer is itself a root
```

---

## Rule: External references may only target aggregate roots

`AggregateReference<Target, IdType>` is only valid when `Target` is an aggregate root (`aggregateRootFqn == null`). When
another aggregate needs to point at an **owned child** — e.g. `Visit` (root) must reference `Pet`, which is owned by
`Owner` — that constraint does **not** license a fallback to a raw FK column. There is no legal shape for referencing a
member of another aggregate; a raw `Long petId` is not a "canonical pattern for non-roots", it is the same raw-FK
violation flagged above, and it is worse than invisible:

- `referencedBy` in `get_jdbc_entity_details` only tracks `AggregateReference` fields, so every boundary check in this
  skill (including the "do not demote while `referencedBy` is non-empty" guard) silently stops seeing the link;
- nothing ties the row to the aggregate contract — the owner root can be deleted (cascading its children away) while
  outside rows still point at the vanished member.

Wanting to reference a non-root means one of three things is true. Pick one explicitly — and if the domain intent is
unclear, ask the developer (AskUserQuestion in Claude Code; inline otherwise) instead of silently picking a shape:

1. **The direction is framed wrong.** A "many-to-one from my root to their member" is usually a one-to-many *from their
   member to my root* read from the FK side (a JPA habit — in JPA the many side always holds the FK; here it must not).
   Re-frame and apply the one-to-many rule below with the member as the holder: e.g. `Pet` owns `Set<PetVisitRef>` via
   `@MappedCollection`, each entry holding `AggregateReference<Visit, Long>`.
2. **The member is a root in disguise.** Being referenced from outside the aggregate is the classic signal of an
   independent lifecycle — the `@Embedded` rule below already states this for value objects, and it applies equally to
   owned children. Promote it via "Converting an owned child into a separate aggregate", then link with a plain
   `AggregateReference<Pet, Long>`.
3. **The root is what you really mean.** If the outside aggregate needs the cluster rather than the specific member,
   reference the owning root (`AggregateReference<Owner, Long>`) and resolve member-level detail through the root at the
   service layer.

```java
// WRONG — raw FK to an owned child of another aggregate
@Column(value = "pet_id")
private Long petId; // Pet is owned by Owner: link invisible to tooling, dangles on Owner deletion
```

```java
// WRONG — AggregateReference to a non-root
@Column(value = "pet_id")
private AggregateReference<Pet, Long> pet; // Pet has no repository; nothing can resolve this
```

## Rule: One-to-many between two aggregates goes through a link entity

**TL;DR:** If both participants are aggregate roots (`@Table` + `@Id`), **never** use direct `@MappedCollection` between
them. Create a link entity. This rule has **no exceptions**.

When a one-to-many relationship must connect two **different aggregates** — the "many" side is another aggregate root —
model it with an additional link entity backed by its own table, combining `@MappedCollection` and `AggregateReference`.
This applies **without exception** regardless of the holding side's role:

- **root → root** — an aggregate root must point at many roots of another aggregate (e.g. `Order` → many `Product`);
- **member → root** — an owned child (member) inside one aggregate must point at many roots of another aggregate (e.g.
  `OrderItem`, owned by `Order`, → many `Warehouse`). The link entity becomes a nested owned child of the aggregate.

The shape: the holding side (whether root or member) owns a collection of link entities via `@MappedCollection`; each
link entity carries an `AggregateReference<Target, IdType>` to the other aggregate root. The link entity is an owned
child of the holding aggregate's root — no repository of its own, saved and deleted with the holder's root. This keeps
both aggregate boundaries intact: the target root stays an independent aggregate, and the relationship itself lives
inside the holder's aggregate tree.

This rule also applies when the request is phrased from the other side — "each Visit (root) is for one Pet (member of
Owner)" is the same Pet → many Visits relationship read from the FK side. Do not flip the direction so that the root
points at the member: that produces an illegal reference to a non-root (see "External references may only target
aggregate roots" above). The collection of links always sits on the side that may legally hold it, even when the
natural-language phrasing puts the FK on the other side.

```java
// Link entity — owned child of the Order aggregate, its own table
@Table("order_product_ref")
public class OrderProductRef {
    @Column(value = "product_id")
    private AggregateReference<Product, Long> product;
    // attributes of the relationship (quantity, addedAt, ...) live here if needed
}
```

```java
// root → root: Order (root) → many Product (root)
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @MappedCollection(idColumn = "order_id")
    private Set<OrderProductRef> products;
}
```

```java
// member → root: OrderItem is an owned child of Order and needs many Warehouse roots.
// The link entity (OrderItemWarehouseRef) becomes a nested owned child inside the Order aggregate.
public class OrderItem {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    
    @MappedCollection(idColumn = "order_item_id")
    private Set<OrderItemWarehouseRef> warehouses; // each holds AggregateReference<Warehouse, Long>
}

// The link entity is owned by OrderItem (which is owned by Order).
// Order aggregate tree: Order → OrderItem → OrderItemWarehouseRef → (ref to Warehouse root)
@Table("order_item_warehouse_ref")
public class OrderItemWarehouseRef {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    
    @Column(value = "warehouse_id")
    private AggregateReference<Warehouse, Long> warehouse;
    // relationship attributes (quantity, location, ...) live here if needed
}
```

```java
// WRONG — @MappedCollection pointing directly at another aggregate root:
// makes Product an owned child of Order, so saving an Order would
// re-insert/delete Product rows and destroy Product's independent lifecycle
@MappedCollection(idColumn = "order_id")
private Set<Product> products;
```

```java
// EXAMPLE OF COMMON MISTAKE: Pet → Visit one-to-many (both are aggregate roots)
// WRONG — Direct @MappedCollection makes Visit an owned child of Pet
public class Pet {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    
    @MappedCollection(idColumn = "pet_id")  // ← WRONG! Visit is a root, not a child
    private Set<Visit> visits;
}

public class Visit {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    // Visit is destroyed when Pet is deleted — loses independent lifecycle
}
```

```java
// CORRECT — Pet → Visit one-to-many via link entity (PetVisitRef)
@Table("pet_visit_ref")
public class PetVisitRef {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    
    @Column(value = "visit_id")
    private AggregateReference<Visit, Long> visit;
}

public class Pet {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    
    @MappedCollection(idColumn = "pet_id")
    private Set<PetVisitRef> visits;  // ← Collection of links, not direct Visit refs
}

public class Visit {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    // Visit is independent — survives even if Pet is deleted
}
```

```java
// WRONG — @MappedCollection on a member pointing directly at another aggregate root:
// OrderItem is already owned by Order; this would make Product doubly owned.
// Always use a link entity between owned members and external roots.
public class OrderItem {
    @MappedCollection(idColumn = "order_item_id")
    private Set<Warehouse> warehouses; // WRONG — use OrderItemWarehouseRef instead
}
```

```java
// WRONG — a bag of raw FK ids: loses the typed link and the schema's FK intent
private Set<Long> productIds;
```

If the relationship carries no attributes at all, a bare `Set<AggregateReference<Product, Long>>` under
`@MappedCollection` (link table without a dedicated class) is an acceptable compact variant — but the explicit link
entity is the default, because it survives the moment the relationship grows attributes without a schema-shape change.

To query in the opposite direction ("which orders contain product X?"), write a `@Query` on the holder root's repository
joining through the link table — do not add a repository for the link entity.

---

## Rule: Many-to-many between two aggregates goes through a link entity

A many-to-many relationship between two aggregates follows the **same pattern** as the one-to-many rule above: an
additional link entity with its own table, owned via `@MappedCollection`, carrying an
`AggregateReference<Target, IdType>`. As with one-to-many, this applies regardless of whether the holding side is a
root (root → root) or an owned member inside an aggregate (member → root).

The Java shape is identical to the one-to-many link — what makes the relationship many-to-many is only that the same
target root may appear in link rows of many holders. The one decision many-to-many adds is **which side owns the link
collection**. Exactly one side does — pick the side from which the relationship is naturally created and modified in the
domain (the side whose save should rewrite the link rows). The other side never gets a mirror collection; it reads the
relationship through a query.

```java
// Link entity — owned child of the Student aggregate, its own table
@Table("student_course_ref")
public class StudentCourseRef {
    @Column(value = "course_id")
    private AggregateReference<Course, Long> course;
    // attributes of the relationship (enrolledAt, grade, ...) live here if needed
}
```

```java
// Student (root) ↔ Course (root), owned from the Student side:
// enrolling/unenrolling is done by mutating student.courses and saving the Student
public class Student {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @MappedCollection(idColumn = "student_id")
    private Set<StudentCourseRef> courses;
}
```

```java
// Course stays an independent root with NO collection back to Student.
// "Who is enrolled in course X?" is a query on the owning side's repository:
public interface StudentRepository extends CrudRepository<Student, Long> {
    @Query("""
        SELECT s.* FROM student s
        JOIN student_course_ref scr ON scr.student_id = s.id
        WHERE scr.course_id = :courseId
        """)
    List<Student> findAllByCourseId(Long courseId);
}
```

```java
// WRONG — mirror collections on both sides: two aggregates would both own
// the same link table and overwrite each other's rows on save
public class Course {
    @MappedCollection(idColumn = "course_id")
    private Set<CourseStudentRef> students; // the Student side already owns the link
}
```

```java
// WRONG — @MappedCollection pointing directly at the other root
@MappedCollection(idColumn = "student_id")
private Set<Course> courses; // would make every Course an owned child of one Student
```

When the relationship itself has an independent lifecycle — it is created/queried/modified on its own, from both sides,
or carries substantial data (`Enrollment` with status, history, payments) — promote the link entity to its **own
aggregate root** with two `AggregateReference` fields (`AggregateReference<Student, …>` +
`AggregateReference<Course, …>`) and its own repository, and drop the `@MappedCollection` from both sides. At that point
it is no longer a link table but a domain concept in its own right.

---

## Rule: Converting an owned child into a separate aggregate

When the project decides that an owned child must become its own aggregate (independent lifecycle, its own repository),
the migration has four mandatory steps:

1. Add `@Table("...")` (or `@Table(name = "...", schema = "...")`) to the child if missing, and ensure its `@Id` is in
   place — declared directly on the child, or inherited from a base class. The table likely already exists; the change
   is only on the Java side.
2. Replace the parent's `@MappedCollection` field. The right shape depends on cardinality:
    - **Parent had a single child** — `AggregateReference<Child, IdType>` field on the parent. Straightforward.
    - **Parent had a collection of children** — this is now a one-to-many between two aggregates; apply the "One-to-many
      between two aggregates goes through a link entity" rule above: introduce a link entity owned by the parent via
      `@MappedCollection`, each entry holding `AggregateReference<Child, IdType>`. Inverting the direction instead (
      dropping the field on the parent and adding `AggregateReference<Parent, IdType>` to the now-independent child,
      with the "list" becoming a query on the child's repository) is acceptable only when the domain genuinely treats
      the child as pointing at the parent — confirm with the developer before choosing it.
3. Create a `ChildRepository` extending the conventional base interface (Step 1.5 of repository conventions).
4. Update every read/write path in the codebase: places that previously navigated `parent.getChildren()` now go through
   `childRepository`.

Do not stop after step 1 or 2 — partial migrations leave the codebase in an inconsistent state.

---

## Rule: Converting a separate aggregate into an owned child

The reverse migration is symmetrical:

1. Replace the parent's `AggregateReference<Child, IdType>` field with `@MappedCollection` (the child stays an entity
   with its own `@Id`). Do not convert to `@Embedded` — that would mean dropping the child's identity entirely and
   merging its columns into the parent row, which is a different and much bigger refactor.
2. Delete the `ChildRepository` interface.
3. Remove direct references to `childRepository` everywhere; navigate from the parent instead.

If `get_jdbc_entity_details` shows `referencedBy` is non-empty for the child, **do not** demote it to an owned child
without first removing every external `AggregateReference` to it — those references would dangle.

---

## Rule: Embedded objects do not have identity

`@Embedded` value objects share the parent row, have no `@Id`, and cannot be referenced from elsewhere. Use `@Embedded`
only for value semantics (`Address`, `Money`, `DateRange`). If a thing has its own lifecycle or is referenced from
another aggregate, it is not embeddable.

```java
// CORRECT — Address is a value object
@Embedded.Empty(prefix = "ship_")
private Address shippingAddress;
```

```java
// WRONG — using @Embedded for an entity that other aggregates reference
@Embedded.Empty
private Customer customer; // Customer has identity and a repository
```

---

## Answering "what is in aggregate X?" / "who references X?"

These questions are answered directly from `get_jdbc_entity_details`:

- "What is inside aggregate Foo?" — call the tool for `Foo` and report `aggregates` (each entry has `entityFqn`,
  `fieldName`, `ownerEntityFqn`, `cardinality`).
- "Who references Foo?" — call the tool for `Foo` and report `referencedBy` (each entry has `ownerEntityFqn`,
  `fieldName`, `aggregateRootFqn`).
- "Is Foo a root?" — `aggregateRootFqn == null` ⇒ yes.

Do not crawl the codebase by hand for these answers when the tool returns the same information in one call.

---

## Rule: Aggregate size

Per the **Aggregate size** convention from Step 1.5 (default: ≤ 2 levels of nesting, ≤ 3 owned collections), flag
oversized aggregates during reviews. A deeply nested aggregate is a sign that an inner collection should be split off
into its own root and reached via `AggregateReference`.

This applies to **review** flows — do not unilaterally split aggregates the user has not asked you to change.
